2.1 = explain about aloggirthm general introduction to alog with persudo convention


This book focuses on the worst time complexity insetad of average time for three reasons:
  1. average time are just as bad as worst time complexity
  2. its more demandedd or imprtant in the real time  computing
  3. its more frequent asked


  insertion sort 

   unosrted list  - > sorted list + unsroted list 

   the core concept for this is 
   1. key and compasion value which starts with value that is one index before
   2. if its smaller then place it at the compasion+1 postion
      if its bigger then swap the compasion with next value in index and keep comparing



after that. we have loop invariant  = focues on the three time of true 
and its purpose is to make sure or inspect the correctness of the aloghrimn

with insetion sort has the best case of O(n)
and the worst case of O(n^2)
